# Smart-home

In this project we have built a smart home with different sensors like Smoke Detector, PIR, Ultrasonic and LDR sensor. All these sensors are connected to an Arduino.

Things that you need:

-Arduino
-Smoke detector MQ6
-PIR
-LDR
-Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
-DC power source(Any 12V)
-Relay boards of 2 channels
The final view of circuit is as follows:
